# State Aggregator

## Current Status

The State Aggregator is a work in progress. It works by subscribing to multiple channels to get information about the state of the AGV, then it combines everything into one VDA5050 State message that is sent to Master Control.

The State Aggregator also builds and sends the visualization messages to MC, as well as the connection state messages.

This interface documentation will get updated as more channels get added with their proper type.
